# Time_Series_Visualizer
Data Analysis with Python Project

Page View Time Series Visualizer is a python program that visualizes time series data using a line chart, bar chart and box plots. The program utilizes Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborne to visualize a dataset containing the number of page views each day on the freeCodeCamp.org forum from 2016-05-09 to 2019-12-03. The data visualization provided an understanding of the patterns in visits and identification of yearly and monthly growth.
